Greetings, I'm Nova Lailatul Rizkiyah, currently working as an AWS Developer tech consultant in Japan (part-time and remote from a small district in East Java, Indonesia). I'm honored to be recognized as an AWS Community Builder for two consecutive years and certified as an AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architectâ€“Associate (SAA).

I hold both bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from Institut Teknologi Bandung (Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia). Despite my educational background and as a housewife + mother every day, I have ventured into exploring other areas such as Cloud Computing, Linux-based systems, information technology, and hobbies.

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@studywithnova/) and it will answer **all** your questions.
